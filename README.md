# SNOT Engine
This is an engine that attempts to emulate ProcessingJS, using HTML, SVG, and JavaScript.

## Code Structure
The mechanics of the engine are kept in the `./static/js/mechanics` folder. These should not be changed, unless one wishes to customize the engine.

`./static/js/action.js` contains the code that you should edit in order to use the engine.

`./index.html` renders the shapes drawn in `action.js`.

`./static/css/style.css` centers the canvas in the viewport.
